Smith's tools allow you to work metal, beating it to alter its shape, repair damage, or work raw ingots into useful items.

**_Components._** Smith's tools include hammers, tongs, charcoal, rags, and a whetstone.

**_[[Arcana]] and [[History]]._** Your expertise lends you additional insight when examining metal objects, such as weapons.

**_[[Investigation]]._** You can spot clues and make deductions that others might overlook when an investigation involves armor, weapons, or other metalwork.

**_Repair._** With access to your tools and an open flame hot enough to make metal pliable, you can restore 10 hit points to a damaged metal object for each hour of work.
