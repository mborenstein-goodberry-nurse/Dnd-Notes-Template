A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, [casting spells](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Spells?expansion=34047#toc_10), or similar adventuring activity—the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.  
  
At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost [hit points](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_47). The character also regains spent [Hit Dice](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Character%20Advancement#toc_6), up to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.  
  
A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 [hit point](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=34047#toc_47) at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.
