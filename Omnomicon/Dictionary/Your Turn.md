On your turn, you can **[[move]]** a distance up to your speed and **take one [[action]]**. You decide whether to move first or take your [[action]] first. Your speed- sometimes called your walking speed-is noted on your character sheet.

The most common [[Action|actions]] you can take are described in the "[[Combat#Actions in Combat|Actions in Combat]]" section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.

The "[[Combat#Movement and Position|Movement and Position]]" section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.

You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in "[[Combat#Actions in Combat|Actions in Combat]]."
