Lightning damage refers to harm caused by high-voltage electricity, which you're unlikely to come across through normal means unless you stand on a tower in full plate mail during a storm (or your DnD setting has discovered electricity). So it's to the DnD spells list we turn once again, where the lightning spells range from small cantrips like [[Shocking Grasp]] to big hitters like [[Chain Lightning]].
