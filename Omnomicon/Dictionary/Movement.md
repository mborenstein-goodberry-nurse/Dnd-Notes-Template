In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.

Your movement can include [[jumping]], [[Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling|Climbing]], and [[Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling|swimming]]. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.

## Breaking Up Your Move

You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.

### Moving between Attacks

If you take an [[action]] that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a [[fighter]] who can make two attacks with the [[Fighter#Extra Attack|Extra Attack]] feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.

### Using Different Speeds

If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.

For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the *[[fly]]* spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.
