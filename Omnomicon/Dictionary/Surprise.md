A band of adventurers sneaks up on a [[bandit]] camp, springing from the trees to attack them. A [[Gelatinous Cube]] glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.  
  
The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the [[Stealth|Dexterity (Stealth)]]] checks of anyone hiding with the [[Passive Perception|Passive Wisdom (Perception)]] score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.  
  
If you’re surprised, you can’t [[Movement|move]] or take an [[action]] on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a [[reaction]] until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.
