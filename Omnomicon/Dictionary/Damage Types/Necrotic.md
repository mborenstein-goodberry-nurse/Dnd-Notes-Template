The flipside of [[Radiant]] damage, Necrotic is best described as 'unholy'. Rather than Devils though, it's specifically related to the Undead, who are both its main users and the monster type you don't want to target. Interestingly, while some Undead are resistant or immune to necrotic attacks, not all of them are. You're probably better off hitting a Skeleton or Zombie with Chill Touch than slashing it with your sword.
