While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GMâ€™s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful [[Athletics|Strength (Athletics)]] check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful [[Athletics|Strength (Athletics)]] check.
