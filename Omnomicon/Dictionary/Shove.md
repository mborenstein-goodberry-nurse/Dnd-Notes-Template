Using the [[Attack|Attack action]], you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it [[prone]] or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the [[Attack|Attack action]], this attack replaces one of them.  
The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a [[Athletics|Strength (Athletics)]] check contested by the target’s [[Athletics|Strength (Athletics)]] or [[Acrobatics|Dexterity (Acrobatics)]] (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.
