### Attack

The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.  
With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the “[[Combat#Making an Attack|Making an Attack]]” section for the rules that govern attacks.  
  
Certain features, such as the [[Fighter#Extra Attack|Extra Attack]] feature of the [[Fighter]], allow you to make more than one attack with this action.
