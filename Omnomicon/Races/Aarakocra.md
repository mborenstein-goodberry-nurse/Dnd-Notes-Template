# Aarakocra 

## Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse

**_A winged people who originated on the Elemental Plane of Air, aarakocra soar through the sky wherever they wander. The first aarakocra served the Wind Dukes of Aaqa — mighty beings of air — and were imbued with a measure of their masters’ power over winds. Their descendants still command echoes of that power._**

**_From below, aarakocra look like large birds and thus are sometimes called birdfolk. Only when they roost on a branch or walk across the ground is their Humanoid nature clear. Standing upright, aarakocra are typically about 5 feet tall, and they have long, narrow legs that taper to sharp talons. Feathers cover their bodies — usually red, orange, yellow, brown, or gray. Their heads are also avian, often resembling those of parrots or eagles._**

- **Ability Score Increase.** When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.

- **Creature Type.** You are a Humanoid.

- **Size.** Your size is Medium.

- **Speed.** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

- **Flight.** Because of your wings, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can’t use this flying speed if you’re wearing [[Medium Armor|medium]] or [[heavy armor]].

- **Talons.** You have talons that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your [[Strength]] modifier [[slashing]] damage, instead of the [[bludgeoning]] damage normal for an unarmed strike.

- **Wind Caller.** Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [[Gust of Wind]] spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you cast the spell with this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a [[long rest]]. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of 2nd level or higher.
    - [[Intelligence]], [[Wisdom]], or [[Charisma]] is your spellcasting ability for it when you cast [[Gust of Wind]] with this trait (choose when you select this race).

- **Languages.** Your character can speak, read, and write [[Common]] and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The _Player’s Handbook_ offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.
