## Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse

### Sea Elf 

**_Sea elves fell in love with the wild beauty of the ocean in the earliest days of the multiverse. While other elves traveled from realm to realm, sea elves navigated the currents and explored the waters of many worlds. Today these elves can be found wherever oceans exist, as well as in the Elemental Plane of Water._**

**_Like other elves, sea elves can live to be over 750 years old._**

- **Ability Score Increase.** When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.

- **Creature Type.** You are a Humanoid. You are also considered an elf for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be an elf.

- **Size.** You are Medium.

- **Speed.** Your walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

- **Child of the Sea.** You can breathe air and water, and you have resistance to [[cold]] damage.

- **Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

- **Fey Ancestry.** You have [[advantage]] on saving throws you make to avoid or end the [[charmed]] condition on yourself.

- **Friend of the Sea.** Aquatic animals have an extraordinary affinity with your people. You can communicate simple ideas to any Beast that has a [[Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling|Swimming]] speed. It can understand your words, though you have no special ability to understand it in return.

- **Keen Senses.** You have proficiency in the [[Perception]] skill.

- **Trance.** You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep. You can finish a [[long rest]] in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike meditation, during which you retain consciousness.
    - Whenever you finish this trance, you can gain two proficiencies that you don’t have, each one with a weapon or a tool of your choice selected from the _Player’s Handbook_. You mystically acquire these proficiencies by drawing them from shared elven memory, and you retain them until you finish your next [[long rest]].

- **Languages.** Your character can speak, read, and write [[Common]] and [[Languages|one other language]] that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The _Player’s Handbook_ offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

## Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes

### Sea Elf 

**_Sea elves fell in love with the wild beauty of the ocean in the earliest days of the multiverse. While other elves traveled from realm to realm, the sea elves navigated the deepest currents and explored the waters across a hundred worlds. Today, they live in small, hidden communities in the ocean shallows and on the Elemental Plane of Water._**

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your [[Dexterity]] score increases by 2, and your [[Constitution]] score increases by 1.

- **Age.** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.

- **Size.** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

- **Darkvision.** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

- **Fey Ancestry.** You have [[advantage]] on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put you to sleep.

- **Trance.** Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is "trance." While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.

- **Keen Senses.** You have proficiency in the [[Perception]] skill.

- **Sea Elf Training.** You have proficiency with the spear, trident, light crossbow, and net.
