# Water Genasi 

## Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse

**_Tracing their ancestry to the genies of the Elemental Planes, each genasi can tap into the power of one of the elements. Air, earth, fire, and water — these are the four pillars of the Material Plane and the four types of genasi. Some genasi are direct descendants of a genie, while others were born to non-genasi parents who lived near a place suffused by a genie’s magic._**

**_A typical genasi has a life span of 120 years_**

**_Water genasi descend from marids, aquatic genies from the Elemental Plane of Water. Water genasi are perfectly suited to life underwater and carry the power of the waves inside themselves._**

**_Their skin is often shades of blue or green, sometimes a blend of the two. If they have a human skin tone, there is a glistening texture that catches the light, like water droplets or nearly invisible fish scales. Their hair can resemble seaweed, waving as if in a current, or it can even be like water itself._**

- **Ability Score Increase.** When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.

- **Creature Type.** You are a Humanoid.

- **Size.** You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.

- **Speed.** Your walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

- **Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

- **Acid Resistance.** You have resistance to [[acid]] damage.

- **Amphibious.** You can breathe air and water.

- **Call to the Wave.** You know the [[Acid Splash]] cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [[Create or Destroy Water]] spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the [[Water Walk]] spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you cast Create or Destroy Water or Water Walk with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a [[long rest]]. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.
    - [[Intelligence]], [[Wisdom]], or [[Charisma]] is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).

- **Languages.** Your character can speak, read, and write [[Common]] and [[Languages|one other language]] that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The _Player’s Handbook_ offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.
