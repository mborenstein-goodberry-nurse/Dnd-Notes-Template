### Hobgoblin 

**_Hobgoblins trace their origins to the ancient courts of the Feywild, where they first appeared with their goblin and bugbear kin. Many of them were driven from the Feywild by the conquering god Maglubiyet, who marshaled them as soldiers, but the fey realm left its mark; wherever they are in the multiverse, they continue to channel an aspect of the Feywild’s rule of reciprocity, which creates a mystical bond between the giver and the receiver of a gift._**

**_On some worlds, such bonds lead hobgoblins to form communities with deep ties to one another. In Eberron and the Forgotten Realms, vast hobgoblin legions have emerged, with ranks of devoted soldiers famed for their unity._**

**_Hobgoblins are generally taller than their goblin cousins but not quite as big as bugbears. They have curved, pointed ears and noses that turn bright red or blue during displays of emotion._**

- **Ability Score Increase.** When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.

- **Creature Type.** You are a Humanoid. You are also considered a goblinoid for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a goblinoid.

- **Size.** You are Medium.

- **Speed.** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

- **Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

- **Fey Ancestry.** You have [[advantage]] on saving throws you make to avoid or end the [[charmed]] condition on yourself.

- **Fey Gift.** You can use this trait to take the [[Help]] action as a [[bonus action]], and you can do so a number of times equal to your [[proficiency bonus]]. You regain all expended uses when you finish a [[long rest]].
    - Starting at 3rd level, choose one of the options below each time you take the [[Help]] action with this trait:
        - **Hospitality.** You and the creature you help each gain a number of [[temporary hit points]] equal to 1d6 plus your proficiency bonus.
        - **Passage.** You and the creature you help each increase your walking speeds by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
        - **Spite.** Until the start of your next turn, the first time the creature you help hits a target with an attack roll, that target has [[disadvantage]] on the next attack roll it makes within the next minute.

- **Fortune from the Many.** If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can draw on your bonds of reciprocity to gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +3). You can use this trait a number of times equal to your [[proficiency bonus]], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[long rest]]. 

- **Languages.** Your character can speak, read, and write [[Common]] and [[Languages|one other language]] that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The _Player’s Handbook_ offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

### Hobgoblin 

_**War is the lifeblood of hobgoblins. Its glories are the dreams that inspire them. Its horrors don't feature in their nightmares. Cowardice is more terrible to hobgoblins than dying, for they carry their living acts into the afterlife. A hero in death becomes a hero eternal.**_

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your [[Constitution]] score increases by 2, and your [[Intelligence]] score increases by 1.

- **Age.** Hobgoblins mature at the same rate as humans and have lifespans similar in length to theirs.

- **Alignment.** Hobgoblin society is built on fidelity to a rigid, unforgiving code of conduct. As such, they tend toward lawful evil.

- **Size.** Hobgoblins are between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh between 150 and 200 pounds. Your size is Medium.

- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

- **Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

- **Martial Training.** You are proficient with two [[martial weapons]] of your choice and with light armor.

- **Saving Face.** Hobgoblins are careful not to show weakness in front of their allies, for fear of losing status. If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +5). Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a [[Short Rest|short]] or [[long rest]].

- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write [[Common]] and [[Goblin]].
