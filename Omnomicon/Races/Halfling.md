# Halfling

## Player's Handbook

_**The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings' lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies. Others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.**_

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your [[Dexterity]] score increases by 2.

- **Age.** A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century.

- **Alignment.** Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of the old ways.

- **Size.** Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is small.

- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

- **Lucky.** When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die. You must use the new result, even if it is a 1.

- **Nimble.** You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.

## Lightfoot

**_As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You're inclined to be affable and get along well with others. In the Forgotten Realms, lightfoot halflings have spread the farthest and thus are the most common variety._**

**_Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life. In the world of Grayhawk, these halflings are called hairfeet or tallfellows._**

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your [[Charisma]] score increases by 1.

- **Naturally Stealthy.** You can attempt to hide even when you are only obscured by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.

## Stout

**_As a stout halfling, you're hardier than average and have some resistance to poison. Some say that stouts have dwarven blood. In the Forgotten Realms, these halflings are called stronghearts, and they're most common in the south._**

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your [[Constitution]] score increases by 1.

- **Stout Resilience.** You have [[advantage]] on saving throws against [[poison]], and you have resistance to [[poison]] damage.
