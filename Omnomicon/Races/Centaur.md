### Centaur 

**_Centaurs gallop throughout the multiverse and trace their origins to many different realms. The centaurs presented here hail from the Feywild and mystically resonate with the natural world. From the waist up, they resemble elves, displaying all the elf varieties of skin tone. From the waist down, they have the bodies of horses._**

- **Ability Score Increase.** When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.

- **Creature Type.** You are a Fey.

- **Size.** Your size is Medium.

- **Speed.** Your walking speed is 40 feet.

- **Charge.** If you move at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, you can immediately follow that attack with a [[bonus action]], making one attack against the target with your hooves.

- **Equine Build.** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag.
    - In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your equine legs. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet instead of the normal 1 extra foot.

- **Hooves.** You have hooves that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your [[Strength]] modifier [[bludgeoning]] damage, instead of the [[bludgeoning]] damage normal for an unarmed strike.

- **Natural Affinity.** Your fey connection to nature gives you an intuitive connection to the natural world and the animals within it. You therefore have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: [[Animal Handling]], [[Medicine]], [[Nature]], or [[Survival]].

- **Languages.** Your character can speak, read, and write [[Common]] and [[Languages|one other language]] that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The _Player’s Handbook_ offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.
