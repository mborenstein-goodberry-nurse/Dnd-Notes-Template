## Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse

**_The first goliaths lived on the highest mountain peaks — far above the tree line, where the air is thin and frigid winds howl. Distantly related to giants and infused with the supernatural essence of their ancestors’ mountainous home, goliaths stand between 7 and 8 feet tall and have a wide array of skin tones resembling different types of stone._**

- **Ability Score Increase.** When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.

- **Creature Type.** You are a Humanoid.

- **Size.** You are Medium.

- **Speed.** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

- **Little Giant.** You have proficiency in the [[Athletics]] skill, and you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

- **Mountain Born.** You have resistance to [[cold]] damage. You also naturally acclimate to high altitudes, even if you’ve never been to one. This includes elevations above 20,000 feet.

- **Stone's Endurance.** You can supernaturally draw on unyielding stone to shrug off harm. When you take damage, you can use your [[reaction]] to roll a d12. Add your [[Constitution]] modifier to the number rolled and reduce the damage by that total.
    - You can use this trait a number of times equal to your [[proficiency bonus]], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[long rest]].

- **Languages.** Your character can speak, read, and write [[Common]] and [[Languages|one other language]] that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The _Player’s Handbook_ offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.
