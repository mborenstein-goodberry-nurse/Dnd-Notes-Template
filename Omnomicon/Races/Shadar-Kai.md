# Shadar-Kai

## Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse

**_Shadar-kai are the elves of the Shadowfell, originally drawn to that dread realm by the Raven Queen. Over the centuries, some of them have continued to serve her, while others have ventured into the Material Plane to forge their own destinies._**

**_Once shadar-kai were Fey like the rest of their elven kin; now they exist in a state between life and death, thanks to being transformed by the Shadowfell’s grim energy._**

**_Shadar-kai have ashen skin tones, and while they’re in the Shadowfell, they also become wizened, reflecting the somber nature of that gloomy plane._**

**_Like other elves, shadar-kai can live to be over 750 years old._**

- **Ability Score Increase.** When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.

- **Creature Type.** You are a Humanoid. You are also considered an elf for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be an elf.

- **Size.** You are Medium.

- **Speed.** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

- **Blessing of the Raven Queen.** As a [[bonus action]], you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your [[proficiency bonus]], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[long rest]].
    - Starting at 3rd level, you also gain resistance to all damage when you teleport using this trait. The resistance lasts until the start of your next turn. During that time, you appear ghostly and translucent.

- **Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

- **Fey Ancestry.** You have [[advantage]] on saving throws you make to avoid or end the [[charmed]] condition on yourself.

- **Keen Senses.** You have proficiency in the [[Perception]] skill.

- **Necrotic Resistance.** You have resistance to [[necrotic]] damage.

- **Trance.** You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep. You can finish a [[long rest]] in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike meditation, during which you retain consciousness.
    - Whenever you finish this trance, you can gain two proficiencies that you don’t have, each one with a weapon or a tool of your choice selected from the _Player’s Handbook_. You mystically acquire these proficiencies by drawing them from shared elven memory, and you retain them until you finish your next [[long rest]].

- **Languages.** Your character can speak, read, and write [[Common]] and [[Languages|one other language]] that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The _Player’s Handbook_ offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.

## Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes

**_Sworn to the Raven Queen's service, the mysterious shadar-kai venture into the Material Plane from the Shadowfell to advance her will. Once they were fey like the rest of their elven kin, and now they exist in a strange state between life and death. Eladrin and shadar-kai are like reflections of each other: one bursting with emotion, the other nearly devoid of it._**

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your [[Dexterity]] score increases by 2, and your [[Constitution]] score increases by 1.

- **Age.** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.

- **Size.** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

- **Darkvision.** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

- **Fey Ancestry.** You have [[advantage]] on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put you to sleep.

- **Trance.** Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is "trance." While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.

- **Keen Senses.** You have proficiency in the [[Perception]] skill.

- **Necrotic Resistance.** You have resistance to [[necrotic]] damage.

- **Blessing of the Raven Queen.** As a [[bonus action]], you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a [[long rest]]. Starting at 3rd level, you also gain resistance to all damage when you teleport using this trait. The resistance lasts until the start of your next turn. During that time, you appear ghostly and translucent.

- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write [[Common]] and [[Elven]].
