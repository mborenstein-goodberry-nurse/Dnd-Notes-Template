# Tortle 

## Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse

**_Tortles have a saying: “We wear our homes on our backs.” These turtle folk live on many worlds, most often journeying up and down coasts, along waterways, and across the sea. Tortles don’t have a unified story of how they were created, but they all have a sense of being mystically connected to the natural world. Carrying their shelter on their backs gives tortles a special feeling of security wherever they go, for even if they visit a far, unknown country, they have a place to lay their heads._**

**_Tortles exhibit the same range of coloration and patterns found among turtles, and many tortles enjoy adorning their shells in distinctive ways._**

- **Ability Score Increase.** When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. You can't raise any of your scores above 20.

- **Creature Type.** You are a Humanoid.

- **Size.** You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.

- **Speed.** Your walking speed is 30 feet.

- **Claws.** You have claws that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your [[Strength]] modifier [[slashing]] damage, instead of the [[bludgeoning]] damage normal for an unarmed strike.

- **Hold Breath.** You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour.

- **Natural Armor.** Your shell provides you a base AC of 17 (your [[Dexterity]] modifier doesn’t affect this number). You can’t wear [[Light Armor|light]], [[Medium Armor|medium]], or [[heavy armor]], but if you are using a [[shield]], you can apply the shield’s bonus as normal.

- **Nature's Intuition.** Thanks to your mystical connection to nature, you gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: [[Animal Handling]], [[Medicine]], [[Nature]], [[Perception]], [[Stealth]], or [[Survival]].

- **Shell Defense.** You can withdraw into your shell as an [[action]]. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to your AC, and you have [[advantage]] on [[Strength]] and [[Constitution]] saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, your speed is 0 and can’t increase, you have [[disadvantage]] on [[Dexterity]] saving throws, you can’t take [[reactions]], and the only action you can take is a [[bonus action]] to emerge from your shell.

- **Languages.** Your character can speak, read, and write [[Common]] and [[Languages|one other language]] that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. The _Player’s Handbook_ offers a list of languages to choose from. The DM is free to modify that list for a campaign.
