### Tenets Of Glory

The tenets of the Oath of Glory drive a paladin to attempt heroics that might one day shine in legend.

**Actions over Words.** Strive to be known by glorious deeds, not words.

**Challenges Are but Tests.** Face hardships with courage, and encourage your allies to face them with you.

**Hone the Body.** Like raw stone, your body must be worked so its potential can be realized.

**Discipline the Soul.** You must marshal the discipline to overcome failings within yourself that threaten to dim the glory of you and your friends.

### Channel Divinity

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.

- **_Peerless Athlete._** As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to augment your athleticism. For the next 10 minutes, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks; you can carry, push, drag, and lift twice as much weight as normal; and the distance of your long and high jumps increases by 10 feet (this extra distance costs movement as normal).

- **_Inspiring Smite._** Immediately after you deal damage to a creature with your Divine Smite feature, you can use your Channel Divinity as a bonus action and distribute temporary hit points to creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you, which can include you. The total number of temporary hit points equals 2d8 + your level in this class, divided among the chosen creatures however you like.

### Aura of Alacrity

At 7th level, you emanate an aura that fills you and your companions with supernatural speed, allowing you to race across a battlefield in formation. Your walking speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, if you aren't incapacitated, the walking speed of any ally who starts their turn within 5 feet of you increases by 10 feet until the end of that turn.

When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of the aura increases to 10 feet.

### Glorious Defense

When you reach 15th level, you can turn defense into a sudden strike. When you or another creature you can see within 10 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant a bonus to the target's AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). If the attack misses, you can make one weapon attack against the attacker as part of this reaction, provided the attacker is within your weapon's range.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Living Legend

At 20th level, you can empower yourself with the legends — whether true or exaggerated — of your great deeds. As a bonus action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

- You are blessed with an otherworldly presence, gaining advantage on all Charisma checks.

- Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack and miss, you can cause that attack to hit instead.

- If you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to reroll it. You must use this new roll.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.
