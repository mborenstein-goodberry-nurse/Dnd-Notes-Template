### [[Fire Storm]]

Source: Player's Handbook

*7th-level [[evocation]]

**Casting Time**: 1 [[action]]
**Range**: 150 feet
**Components**: V, S
**Duration**: Instantaneous

A storm made up of sheets of roaring flame appears in a location you choose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to **ten 10-foot cubes**, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must make **[[Dexterity]] saving throw**. It takes **7d10 [[fire]]** damage on a failed save, or **half** as much damage on a successful one.

The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that arenâ€™t being worn or carried. If you choose, plant life in the area is unaffected by this spell.
