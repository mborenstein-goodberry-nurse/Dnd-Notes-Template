### [[Power Word Stun]]

Source: Player's Handbook

*8th-level [[enchantment]]

**Casting Time**: 1 [[action]]
**Range**: 60 feet
**Components**: V, S
**Duration**: Instantaneous

You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has **150 [[hit points]]** or fewer, it is [[stunned]]. Otherwise, the spell has no effect. The [[stunned]] target must make a **[[Constitution]] saving throw** at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.
