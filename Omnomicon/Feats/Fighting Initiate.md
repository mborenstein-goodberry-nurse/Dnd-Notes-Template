_Prerequisite: Proficiency with a [[Omnomicon/Items/Weapons#Martial Weapons|martial weapon]]_

Your martial training has helped you develop a particular style of fighting. As a result, you learn one [[Fighter#Fighting Style|Fighting Style]] option of your choice from the [[fighter]] class. If you already have a style, the one you choose must be different.

Whenever you reach a level that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace this feat's [[Fighter#Fighting Style|Fighting Style]] with another one from the [[fighter]] class that you don't have.
