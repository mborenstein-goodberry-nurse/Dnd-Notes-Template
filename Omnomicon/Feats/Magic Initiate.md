Choose a class: [[Bard Spells|bard]], [[Cleric Spells|cleric]], [[Druid Spells|druid]], [[Sorcerer Spells|sorcerer]], [[Warlock Spells|warlock]], or [[Wizard Spells|wizard]]. You learn two cantrips of your choice from that class's spell list.

In addition, choose one 1st-level spell to learn from that same list. Using this feat, you can cast the spell once at its lowest level, and you must finish a [[long rest]] before you can cast it in this way again.

Your spellcasting ability for these spells depends on the class you chose: [[Charisma]] for bard, sorcerer, or warlock; [[Wisdom]] for cleric or druid; or [[Intelligence]] for wizard.
