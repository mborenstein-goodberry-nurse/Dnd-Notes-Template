_Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature_

Studying occult lore, you learn one [[Eldritch Invocations]] option of your choice from the warlock class. Your spellcasting ability for the invocation is [[Intelligence]], [[Wisdom]], or [[Charisma]] (choose when you select this feat). If the invocation has a prerequisite of any kind, you can choose that invocation only if you’re a [[warlock]] who meets the prerequisite.

Whenever you gain a level, you can replace the [[Eldritch Invocations|invocation]] with another one from the [[warlock]] class.
