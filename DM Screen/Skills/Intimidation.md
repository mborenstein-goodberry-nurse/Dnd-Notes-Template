**Ability**: [[Charisma]]

When trying to scare someone through threats, [[Intimidation]] is used. This can be through words alone, threatening to do something violent; or pulling out a dagger in a silent show. Intimidation can be applied to multiple situations, such as trying to get information out of a prisoner, convincing someone to reconsider their decisions, or showing off your lack of tolerance for nonsense.
