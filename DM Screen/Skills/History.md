**Ability**: [[Intelligence]]

Much like the name suggests, [[History]] is used when recalling lore of the past. This can include wars big or small, legendary people, ancient kingdoms or lost civilizations, and miscellaneous historical events. It's also occasionally used when the name of an obscure land is brought up and determining if anyone knows of it.
