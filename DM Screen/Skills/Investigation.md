**Ability**: [[Intelligence]]

Not to be confused with [[Perception]], [[Investigation]] determines what you're able to deduce about your surroundings or what you're studying. You might be able to figure out what weapon killed someone, locations of hidden doors or objects, weak points in structure, or the important bit of knowledge in a large book of text.
