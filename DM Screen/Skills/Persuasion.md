**Ability**: [[Charisma]]

[[Persuasion]] is used when trying to convince others your way. It is distinct from [[Deception]] and [[Intimidation]] because it's not through lies or threats, but convincing arguments, tact, social graces, and good nature. It's used when acting in good, honest faith. Situations that call for persuasion include convincing guards to let you speak to a noble, settling disputes between warring groups, or inspiring crowds into action.
