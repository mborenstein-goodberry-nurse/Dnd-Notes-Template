**Ability**: [[Wisdom]]

[[Perception]] is among the most well-known skills, and is frequently mistakenly used in place of investigation. It's used to determine how much a character notices of their surroundings. This can be intentional or not. It relies on basic senses rather than contemplative thought or deductions. Situations that might call for [[Perception]] include standing guard, eavesdropping, and detecting hidden creatures or subtle sights.
