## Overview
Dexterity covers a creature’s fine motor skills, balance, and control over their body. Dexterous characters are often lithe, agile, and quick. As this Ability Score increases, so does:

- Your accuracy and damage with ranged weapons
- Your accuracy and damage with lightweight, quick melee weapons (Finesse)
- Your ability to avoid damage (Armor Class, Dexterity saving throws)
- Your ability to contort and control your body (Acrobatics skill)
- Your ability to act subtly and move quietly (Stealth and Sleight of Hand skills)
- Your reaction time (Initiative)
- Your ability to perform delicate tasks (lock picking, disarming traps, etc)

## Skills 
- [[Acrobatics]] 
- [[Stealth]] 

## Priorities
You should prioritize your Dexterity your character wants to:

- Wield ranged or Finesse weapons (daggers, rapiers, scimitars, etc)
- Be more likely to avoid taking damage
- Act quickly in dangerous situations
- Sneak around without being caught
- Pick locks, pick pockets, and generally do thief-y things

Dexterity determines how many tomatoes a character can juggle at a time.

Dexterity is a very useful ability score that every class benefits from utilizing, but [[Rogue|Rogues]] and [[Monk|Monks]] benefit from it especially.
