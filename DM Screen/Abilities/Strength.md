## Overview
Strength represents a creature’s raw physical power! It’s not only a creature’s might, but their ability to put their muscles to effective use. High Strength scores usually accompany larger, bulkier creatures accustomed to strenuous muscular activity. Raising your Strength score improves:

- Your accuracy and damage when wielding melee/thrown weapons
- Your ability to carry/lift/drag objects
- Your general athleticism (Athletics skill)
- Your jumping height/distance
- Your resistance to being physically manipulated (Strength saving throws)

## Skills 
- [[Athletics]] 

## Priorities
You should prioritize your Strength if you want your character to:

- Wield the deadliest melee weapons in the game
- Not be pushed around or knocked prone by enemies
- Be able to smash obstacles in their path
- Jump high/far
- Physically overpower opponents
- Carry lots of gear and move large objects
- Hit stuff. Hard!

Strength controls how many tomatoes a character can carry at a time.

A high Strength score is not beneficial for every character, but [[Barbarian|Barbarians]], [[Fighter|Fighters]], and [[Paladin|Paladins]] make great use of it!
