## Overview
Creatures use their Wisdom Ability Score not only to take in new information about their surroundings, but also to apply their knowledge in ways that are immediately useful. If they are wise, characters often have keen senses, and know exactly what to do in desperate situations. Having a high Wisdom raises:

- Your situational awareness (Perception skill)
- Your ability to practically apply knowledge (Medicine and Survival skills)
- Your ability to interact with animals (Animal Handling skill)
- Your ability to read people and situations (Insight skill)
- Your strength of will (Wisdom saving throws)
- Your connection to divine or natural power, and your ability to wield it (Spellcasting for [[Cleric|Clerics]], [[Druid|Druids]], and [[Ranger|Rangers]])

## Skills 
- [[Animal Handling]] 
- [[Insight]] 
- [[Medicine]] 
- [[Perception]] 
- [[Survival]] 

## Priorities
Prioritize your character’s Wisdom if you see your character:

- Perceiving danger before it happens
- Possessing an unbreakable will
- Being able to see through lies
- Knowing what to do in an emergency situation
- Making furry friends wherever they go

Wisdom tells us that tomatoes would not make a good ingredient in a fruit salad.

Since nobody likes being mind-controlled, Wisdom is always important! [[Druid|Druids]], [[Cleric|Clerics]], and [[Monk|Monks]] are all able to effectively weaponize their Wisdom Ability Scores with their class features, making this a very important stat for them.
