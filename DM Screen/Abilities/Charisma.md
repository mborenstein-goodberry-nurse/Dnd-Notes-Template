## Overview
Charisma is a creature’s ability to force the world to bend to their will through force of personality. Charismatic characters can be charming or frightening, but always are captivating and impressive! Charisma affects:

- Your ability to make others do what you want (Persuade and Intimidate skills)
- Your ability to entertain and distract others (Performance skill)
- Your ability to impersonate another individual (Performance skill)
- Your ability to convincingly lie (Deception skill)
- Your power to manifest magic through willpower (Spellcasting for [[Bard|Bards]], [[Paladin|Paladins]], [[Sorcerer|Sorcerers]], and Warlocks)
- Your ability to resist possession (Charisma saving throws)

## Skills 
- [[Deception]] 
- [[Intimidation]] 
- [[Performance]] 
- [[Persuasion]] 

## Priorities
Your character’s highest Ability Score should be Charisma if you’d prefer them to:

- Thrive in social situations
- Be able to convince others of facts that are untrue
- Cast magic based off emotion rather than devotion or understanding
- Manipulate others to your whims
- Be fun at parties

Charisma is your ability to sell others on the idea of your new tomato-based fruit salad.

High Charisma scores benefit Bards, Sorcerers, and Warlocks especially, since their magic is fueled by their willpower.
