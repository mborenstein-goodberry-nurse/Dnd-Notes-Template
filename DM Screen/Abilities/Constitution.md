## Overview
A creature’s Constitution expresses a creature’s health and hardiness. Having a high Constitution is accompanied by robust builds and stalwart vigor, as well as an effective immune system. Your Constitution Score governs:


- Your Hit Points (HP)
- Your ability to withstand poisons, diseases, and the like (Constitution saving throws)
- Your ability to take damage without breaking composure (concentration on spells)

## Skills 
Constitution has no skills

## Priorities
Boost your Constitution if you’d like your character to:

- Be able to take plenty of damage
- Be less likely to suffer the effects of natural and magical maladies
- Concentrate on spells in spite of being hurt
- Outdrink other members of the party

Constitution reflects how many tomatoes a character can eat before they get sick.

All characters’ Hit Points are affected by their Constitution, but tanky classes like [[Barbarian|Barbarians]], [[Paladin|Paladins]], and [[Fighter|Fighters]] can really flex a large HP pool.
