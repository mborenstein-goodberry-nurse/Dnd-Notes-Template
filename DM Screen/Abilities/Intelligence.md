## Overview
A creature’s knowledge about the world around them is represented by its Intelligence. Anything that can be learned or memorized through study, education, or careful scrutiny is covered by this Ability Score. Raising your Intelligence also increases:

- Your memorized knowledge about the world and its inhabitants (Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion skills)
- Your ability to locate and interpret clues (Investigation skill)
- Your ability to effectively cast complex arcane formulae (Spellcasting for Wizards)
- Your ability to ward off psychic assaults (Intelligence saving throws)

## Skills 
- [[Arcana]]
- [[History]]
- [[Investigation]]
- [[Nature]] 
- [[z_Templates/1. Story World Templates/Group/Religion|Religion]] 

## Priorities
Emphasize a character’s Intelligence if you want them to:

- Be educated, and likely to be informed on a variety of subjects
- Be an effective sleuth
- Possess the capacity to pontificate profusely, presenting as perfectly pompous or pretentious

Intelligence tells one that a tomato is technically not a vegetable, but a fruit!

Intelligence is mainly used as the Ability Score that makes the Dungeon Master tell you about their world and story, but is much more important to [[Wizard|Wizards]], who use it to determine the effectiveness of their spells.
